## Speed Test Decorator
This project includes a speed test decorator to measure the execution time of functions. 

### Example Functions
- `sum_gen()`: Sums numbers from 0 to 99,999,999 using a generator.
- `sum_list()`: Sums numbers from 0 to 99,999,999 using a list.

### Usage
You can run the `speed_test.py` file to see the execution time for both functions.

## Example Output
When you run the `speed_test.py` file, you will see output similar to the following:

sum_gen started... 
sum_gen finished in 2.3456 seconds 
Result of sum_gen: 4999999950000000 
sum_list started... 
sum_list finished in 5.6789 seconds 
Result of sum_list: 4999999950000000
